* FIXME - The script should make a pass through README to look for a
          line that matches /^[^[:alnum:]]*DESCRIPTION[^[:alnum:]]*$/i
          and use the first paragraph after that, if it exists.

* It might be a good idea to try to render %description as POD.

* Planned features (as of 2005-09-19):

  - Find and download dependencies automatically (like CPAN::Unwind).
  - Download from CPAN automatically when executed as "cpanspec Foo::Bar".
    + DONE!
    + Add --download-only or something similar to replace cpanget.

* It would be useful to be able to write the spec to stdout.

* Add options to filter out Provides/Requires.
  - Done, but the documentation needs work.

* Get Summary using Parse::CPAN::Modlist from 03modlist.data.gz.
