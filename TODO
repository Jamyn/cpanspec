* Planned features (as of 2005-09-19):

  - Download from CPAN automatically when executed as "cpanspec Foo::Bar".
    + DONE!
    + Add --download-only or something similar to replace cpanget.

* Add options to filter out Provides/Requires.
  - Done, but the documentation needs work.

* Check the search path for rpm, rpmbuild, etc. instead of hard-coding
  paths.

* Try to get cpan_home from CPAN::MyConfig or CPAN::Config instead of
  hard-coding $pkgdetails.

* Add an option to honor %_sourcedir and such.
