* This script is known to fail on the following:

    - Cache::Cache 1.02 (Tries to do detection magic in Makefile.PL.)

* PAR 0.92 is arch-specific because of stuff in %{_bindir}, not
  %{perl_vendorarch}.  There's probably a way to detect that.

* There is logic to exclude directories from %doc, but it doesn't
  seem to work all that often.
